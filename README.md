# BackupHelper

- Lightweight interface to facilitate backup of files and directories.
- A variety of settings can be chosen for each transfer including binary comparison.
- The settings are saved into profiles.
------------
Alternatively profiles can be executed directly without the interface:
#### CMD example:
```batch
BackupHelper.exe -nd profilename1;profilename2;profilename3
```
Optional -nd tag can be added to avoid error dialogs during executions
